# Assumptions
1) Structured JSON does not support key nesting (multi-level keys, such as nested JSON), so all of the keys will be provided in one level.
2) All items data CSV files will have the following headers (uuid, title, description and group_id) whilst the groups CSV file will have two headers (uuid and group).
